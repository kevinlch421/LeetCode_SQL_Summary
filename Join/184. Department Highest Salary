# 184. Department Highest Salary

SELECT b.name AS Department, a.name AS Employee, a.Salary 
FROM Employee a
INNER JOIN Department b
ON a.departmentId = b.id 
WHERE (a.departmentId, a.salary) IN  (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
)

# wrong case
# remark: dont use left join but inner join, cause some some employee may have no department
          dont use group by, but where since you are going to find more than one result form subquery

SELECT b.name AS Department, a.name AS Employee, a.Salary 
FROM Employee a
LEFT JOIN Department b
ON a.departmentId = b.id 
GROUP BY a.id
HAVING (a.departmentId, a.salary) IN  (
    SELECT id, MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
)
