# 175. Combine Two Tables
# remark: The LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table
          The result is 0/ NULL records from the right side, if there is no match.
          So see null is pretty sure it is LEFT JOIN

| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Allen     | Wang     | null          | null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |

SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state
FROM Person a
LEFT JOIN Address b
ON a.personId = b.personId;
