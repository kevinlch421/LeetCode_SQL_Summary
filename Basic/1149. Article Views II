# 1149. Article Views II

SELECT DISTINCT viewer_id AS id
FROM Views
GROUP BY viewer_id, view_date  
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1
ORDER BY 1 # means sorting values according to first column in the SELECT statement.

# wrong case
# not on the same date
# no need to use the subquery as having can get the job done
# not viewer_id but article_id to be count, cause it is to find people who viewed more than one article on the same date.
